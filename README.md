# JavaFX_Battle_Project
This is a project created for my Computer Science A class using the JavaFX library to create a basic battle game.

This uses the JavaFX library to create a really simple game similar to Galaga but with a store.

It uses Java to do the calculations and stuff.

There's nothing at all groundbreaking in this because it was a class project.
